Baker Book Is a simple website for you  to search for your baking recipes's.
You can go through the slides and read the data of specific breads and can also click the link to see
how the bread is made by professional bakers!

# What I would optamize in the website

- Username and accounts for people so save and bookmark recipes
- A search engine to look up specific breads.
- Links to recipes page (for those who dont like motion recpies).
- Bookmarking and favorite list, to bookmark future recpies and having a favorite list so people could know those most famous bread recipes being used.
- A Most popular recipes selection bar.
- And lots more.

# What I would optamize in the code

 I would also place the slides into an object for cleaner code. 
 Expanding the project I would use a database (MongoDB) for accounts and storage of people and recipes.
 I would make it fully responsive for the use on mobile and desktop.
