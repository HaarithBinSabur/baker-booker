          <h3>English Muffin</h3>
          
          <p>English muffins are these delightful little round bread discs that originated in England. They're unique in that they're typically split in half, creating a perfect nook for all kinds of toppings.
            <br> The nooks and crannies are iconic in English muffins. This texture is achieved by cooking the dough on a griddle, creating a slightly crispy exterior while keeping the inside soft and fluffy. They're often toasted and then slathered with butter or your topping of choice â€“ maybe some jam, cream cheese, or even eggs Benedict if you're feeling fancy.

            <h3>Sour Dough</h3>
            
            <p>Sourdough is a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a micture of flour and water.Brodly speaking the yeast produces gas(carbon dioxide) which leavens the dough, and the lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, which contributes flavor in the form of sourness.
              <br>
              One of the oldest Sourdough breads dated back to the 1300 BCE and excavated in Switzerland, but the origin of sourdough fermentation likely relates to the origin of agriculture in the Fertile cresent and Egypt several thousand years earlier.        </p>
